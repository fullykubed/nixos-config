name: CVE
description: Identify, triage, and resolve CVE vulnerabilities found by vulnix in a NixOS system. USE WHEN investigating vulnix scan results, fixing a specific CVE, or triaging security vulnerabilities.
---

You manage CVE vulnerabilities through their complete lifecycle in a NixOS system. Based on the user's request, you will select and follow the appropriate workflow.

## When Invoked

1. **Gather Context**: Determine the current state:
   - Has a vulnix scan been run recently?
   - Is the user asking about a specific CVE?
   - Are there existing patches to review?

2. **Determine Intent**: Analyze the user's request to identify:
   - Are they looking to find new vulnerabilities?
   - Do they have a specific CVE to fix?
   - Do they want to review existing patches?
   - Look for trigger words from the Workflow Routing table

3. **Select Workflow**: Select the appropriate workflow based on the user's intent and trigger words:
   1. Does the user want to find vulnerabilities? → **IdentifyCVE**
   2. Does the user have a specific CVE to fix? → **ResolveCVE**
   3. Does the user want to review existing patches? → **ReviewPatches**
   4. When in doubt: Ask the user which workflow they want to use

4. **Execute Workflow**: Report to the user "Running <workflow-name> using the CVE skill..." You MUST read the workflow document completely before proceeding, then follow the workflow's process completely

5. **Report Results**: Summarize what was accomplished and suggest next steps

## Workflow Routing

| Workflow | Trigger Words | When to Use |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| [IdentifyCVE](./workflows/IdentifyCVE.md) | "scan", "check", "find", "detect", "identify", "triage", "vulnerabilities", "run vulnix" | User wants to scan their system and identify real CVE vulnerabilities (includes triaging false positives) |
| [ResolveCVE](./workflows/ResolveCVE.md) | "fix", "patch", "resolve", "whitelist", "apply", "mitigate", "CVE-XXXX-XXXXX" | User has a specific CVE they want to fix via patch or whitelist |
| [ReviewPatches](./workflows/ReviewPatches.md) | "review", "audit", "check patches", "verify", "existing patches", "patch status" | User wants to review existing CVE patches in the repository |

## Whitelist

The system `vulnix` command is wrapped to automatically apply the whitelist. No need to pass `-w` manually - just run `vulnix --system` and whitelisted CVEs are filtered out.

### Whitelist Organization (REQUIRED)

The whitelist file MUST be organized into clearly labeled sections:

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| HASKELL ECOSYSTEM | Package name collisions with C/Rust/JS libs |
| JENKINS PLUGIN COLLISIONS | Jenkins plugins vs CLI tools |
| VS CODE EXTENSION COLLISIONS | VS Code extensions vs CLI tools |
| DIFFERENT SOFTWARE - SAME NAME | Unrelated software sharing names |
| PLATFORM/DISTRO SPECIFIC | CVEs for other platforms/distros |
| ALREADY PATCHED VERSIONS | CVEs fixed in installed versions |
| EOL/LEGACY SOFTWARE | Accepted risk for EOL dependencies |
| BUNDLED DEPENDENCIES | Older libs bundled in other packages |

When adding whitelist entries:
1. Add to the correct section (create if needed)
2. Document what top-level package pulls in the dependency
3. Include version info and what the CVE actually affects
4. Set `until` dates for accepted risks

## Quick Reference

### CVSS Priority Levels
| Score | Severity | Priority |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 9.0-10.0 | Critical | Immediate |
| 7.0-8.9 | High | High |
| 4.0-6.9 | Medium | Moderate |
| 0.1-3.9 | Low | Low |

### Common False Positive Patterns
| Pattern | Example | Why It's False |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Haskell vs other | `curl-0.4.46` (Haskell) | Different software, same name |
| Distro-specific | "Debian avahi package" | NixOS uses upstream |
| Platform-specific | "Discord macOS" | Linux version differs |
| Already fixed | Fixed in "2.4.2", have 2.4.16 | Version already patched |
